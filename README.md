> _“The secret of getting ahead is getting started — and the secret of staying ahead is consistency.”_

Welcome to **DailyCodeLab** — my personal space for daily coding challenges, problem-solving sessions, and growth tracking as an aspiring **Software Engineer and Data Enthusiast** from **South Africa** 🇿🇦.  

This repository is a long-term commitment to writing code every day, improving algorithmic thinking, and building strong engineering discipline. Every file, commit, and folder represents progress — one step closer to mastery.
